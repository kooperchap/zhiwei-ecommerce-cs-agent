## 📋 What is zhiwei-ecommerce-cs-agent?

zhiwei-ecommerce-cs-agent is a software designed to help e-commerce businesses answer customer questions faster and more accurately. It focuses on common challenges like understanding complex inquiries, extracting information from PDF product manuals, and automating routine customer service tasks that usually need human help.

This system uses a smart design that quickly recognizes what a customer needs, fetches business data ahead of time, and has backup options to ensure correct answers. It works by analyzing different types of data — like text, images, and documents — and runs searches and automatic checks to make replies precise and timely.

Even if you don't know much about computers or programming, this agent is built so it can run smoothly on your own computer or business system.
